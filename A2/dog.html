            <p>Explore my love for spaniels through photos and stories.</p>
            <p>The spaniel is a hunter’s companion bred to find, flush, and fetch game, but their exact origin is unknown. Some scholars speculate the type originated in Spain, hence the name. Other research suggests that they originated in Asia and migrated west, to Europe and beyond. Spaniels go back to at least the 14th century, but their ancestry might be even older.</p>
